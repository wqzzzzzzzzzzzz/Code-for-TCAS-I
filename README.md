# Code-for-TCAS-I
  This is a comparative experiment about all the simulation codes mentioned in the paper "Adaptive Filtering Over Complex Networks in Intricate Environments", including simulations in the Gaussian environments, impulse environments, intricate environments, and with more Gaussian components, named Gaussian-Environment, Impulse-Environment, Intricate-Environment, and K, respectively. In the simulations, the alpha stable noise needs to be generated through the function "alpha_noise", and the corresponding topology and node weights also need to be implemented through functions "C" and "Weight", respectively. Please refer to the original text for all experimental parameter settings. Thank you for your patient reading!
